Salvia aims to help you create static blogs from text files (Markdown). With minimal configuration and building, you could quickly start focusing on writing something with ease.

This guide would help you create a minimalist blog site featuring a home page that shows list of your post abstracts, as well as a reader page that displays content of an individual post.

### Install via npm

The easiest way to initialize a new Salvia blog is to use `salvia-cli`:

```bash
// Install Salvia Command Line Interface
$ npm install -g salvia-cli

// Create a new Salvia blog into a new folder "myblog"
$ salvia init myblog
```

### Install Manually

Salvia is no more than a traditional JavaScript library. You can download [the latest version](#) of pre-built `salvia.min.js`, and create your blog files following the [directory structure](#) of Salvia.
